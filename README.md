# Random house generator
### Generate random houses for our big data project

Simply run using `cargo run --release <number of houses>`.\
Ensure that number of houses is a valid signed 32-bit integer (i32 in rust terms).\
A file called "houses.json", will be generated in the folder that the script is ru  n in.
